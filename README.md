# USPS Search Algorithm
The goal of this project written in C++ is to improve the processing speed of mail and packages by recommending the best search algorithm to find USPS tracking ID. I considered three algorithms namely, linked list, binary search tree, and hashtables for searches, and found hashtable to the fastest with constant time complexity.
